<b>The aim of this project is to develop a basic shell using the C programming language. </b>

Shells have an inseparable connection with the inception of IT. In the past, programmers unanimously found the process of communicating with computers through aligned 1s and 0s switches to be exasperating. Hence, it naturally led to the conception of communicating with computers through interactive lines of commands, resembling a language closer to English.
